## [Unreleased]
- Format an 835 file to have no new lines to better handle variable lines. Would then asseumes delimiter is '~'
- Incorporate using a Queue, potentially for processing thread worker's outputs
- Fix progress bar's slight back ticks, should only smoothly move forward
- Cleanup variable names, variable scoping, and add proper class and function comments
- Create Standalone executable. Prior one is outdated and removed
- Fix so that '00000' value when opened in excel doesn't become '0'; surround with quotes?
- Handle variable line length 835s. Consider using replace('\n','') on whole file content so it doesn't
  matter how many lines long the 835 is (including variable)
- Handle I/O errors by accounting for exceptions. Currently not handling any
- Fix so user can choose to append to existing results file on subsequent runs. Currently appends but this
  is unintentional and a coincidence
- Verify and add setting + logic for if subdirectories should be included in file scan
- Implement a way to kill a thread without having to use a daemon thread and killing the app's process
