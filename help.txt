To run this program:
1. Specify the folder where the desired 835 files to be parsed are located.
2. Specify where the parsed results should be saved to
3. Optionally, specify the file pattern the program should use to identify a file as an applicable file to parse. 

The program will look for any files containing or ending with the indicated pattern.

In the settings menu one can toggle whether subsequent runs should append to the initial run's results file or not.
